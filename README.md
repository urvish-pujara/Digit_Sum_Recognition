ML4Science Assignment

*Problem statement: Given an image (and its label value) predict the sum of the digits in the image. 

*DEADLINE for submission: 26 Jan 2023, 10pm.

1. You can train using any model (FCNN, CNN, RNN etc etc)
2. Training data and labels are given. [See DL-Project for the data; data files are "data*.npy" and label files are "lab*.npy" and an load_data.py illustrates how to access data and labels]
3. Additional data can be taken from the internet too to train the model. 
4. Test data will be given later on against which accuracy will be calculated. 
5. Training has to be done in Ada.
6. The final code should be uploaded to Github Repo.
7. Plagiarism will not be entertained. The entire code should be written from scratch.
8. Example code illustrating how to load the data, and one example and its label value demonstrated in below screenshot:
